# Tmux

TODO

[`tmux`](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course) configuration:

* Improved color resolution for modern terminal emulators
* Soften status bar color from harsh green to light gray
* Simplified the status bar to just session name, hostname, and time
* Set leader key to `Ctrl+Space`
* Nested tmux session receives its leader key with `<Leader> Ctrl+Space`
* Switch between sessions with `<Leader> Enter`
* Split window with visually appealing vertical (`|`) and horizontal (`-`) splits

Shell commands:

* `tat` to create/attach to tmux session named the same as the current directory.
* `tlt` to list running tmux sessions
