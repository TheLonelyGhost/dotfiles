TODO: insert photo preview of dotfiles

Requirements
------------

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://gitlab.com/thelonelyghost/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

(Or, [fork and keep your fork
updated](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)).

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    # Mac OS (Homebrew)
    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install rcm

    # Ubuntu
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:martin-frost/thoughtbot-rcm
    sudo apt-get install -y rcm

Install the dotfiles:

    env RCRC=$HOME/.dotfiles/rcrc rcup

After the initial installation, you can run `rcup` without the one-time variable
`RCRC` being set (`rcup` will symlink the repo's `rcrc` to `~/.rcrc` for future
runs of `rcup`). [See
example](https://gitlab.com/thelonelyghost/dotfiles/blob/master/rcrc).

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

* Exclude the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
* Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/.dotfiles-local`
* Copy the templates for new git repositories instead of referencing one
  canonical location for all repositories

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

You should run `rcup` after pulling a new version of the repository to symlink
any new files in the repository.

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.git_template.local/*`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.psqlrc.local` (we supply a blank `.psqlrc.local` to prevent `psql` from
  throwing an error, but you should overwrite the file with your own copy)
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`
* `~/.zsh/configs/*`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = myname@example.com

Your `~/.vimrc.local` might look like this:

    " Color scheme
    colorscheme github
    highlight NonText guibg=#060606
    highlight Folded  guibg=#0A0A0A guifg=#9090D0

To extend your `git` hooks, create executable scripts in
`~/.git_template.local/hooks/*` files.

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # load pyenv if available
    if which pyenv &>/dev/null ; then
      eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    fi

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Plug 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Plug 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'

zsh Configurations
------------------

Additional zsh configuration can go under the `~/.zsh/configs` directory. This
has two special subdirectories: `pre` for files that must be loaded first, and
`post` for files that must be loaded last.

For example, `~/.zsh/configs/pre/virtualenv` makes use of various shell
features which may be affected by your settings, so load it first:

    # Load the virtualenv wrapper
    . /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Setting a key binding can happen in `~/.zsh/configs/keys`:

    # Grep anywhere with ^G
    bindkey -s '^G' ' | grep '

Some changes, like `chpwd`, must happen in `~/.zsh/configs/post/chpwd.zsh`:

    # Show the entries in a directory whenever you cd in
    function chpwd {
      ls
    }

This directory is handy for combining dotfiles from multiple teams; one team
can add the `virtualenv` file, another `keys`, and a third `chpwd`.

The `~/.zshrc.local` is loaded after `~/.zsh/configs`.

vim Configurations
------------------

Similarly to the zsh configuration directory as described above, vim
automatically loads all files in the `~/.vim/plugin` directory. This does not
have the same `pre` or `post` subdirectory support that our `zshrc` has.

This is an example `~/.vim/plugin/c.vim`. It is loaded every time vim starts,
regardless of the file name:

    # Indent C programs according to BSD style(9)
    set cinoptions=:0,t0,+4,(4
    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.[ch] setlocal sw=0 ts=8 noet
