While yer in the ranchin' mood, why don't ya try this recipe for bacon 'n beans?

Ingredients

1 pound 90% lean ground beef*
1 pound bacon
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 (28 ounce) cans baked beans (I used Bush's Original)
1 (15 ounce) can pork and beans
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup barbecue sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's Originial)
1/4 cup yellow mustard
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Instructions

Cook the bacon in a large skillet. You can either chop it beforehand or crumble
it afterward. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate. Brown the ground beef in a
the bacon grease. Remove to a large bowl and discard the fat. Preheat the oven
to 400 degrees F. Saut√© the onions until they are translucent, about 5-8
minutes. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bacon, onions, baked beans, pork
and beans, black beans, barbecue sauce, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Taste
it. Add more BBQ sauce if you want. Spread the beans into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake
at 400 for 30 minutes. Turn the oven down to 350 and cover the beans with foil.
Bake for another 20-30 minutes. I like mine extra crispy on top, so I broil
them for a couple minutes, but that's not necessary unless you like slightly
burned beans. (I mean who doesn't.) Serve hot!

Notes:

*Use 90%, otherwise your beans will end up greasy.
